- The reported times zeros because the time is less that 0.01. Therefore, the time is not captured in the 2 decimal spaces provided
- factors_itr is only called once every time the program is run it is not a recursive function. It is called once in the main function and is not called again
-
40: 16 recursive calls,  4 prime factors, 8 factors
79: 1 recursive call,  1 prime factor, 2 factors
240: 27 recursive calls, 6 prime factors, 20 factors
300: 16 recursive calls, 5 prime factors, 18 factors
999: 2 recursive calls, 4 prime factors, 8 factors
4000: 84 recursive calls, 8 prime factors, 24 factors

In general, the number of recursive calls increases as the number of factors and prime factors increases.
